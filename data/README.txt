* tweets.json: Generated by the scraper. Contains the scraped tweets (one line per tweet). Note, this is not the raw data. All duplicate and spam tweets have been removed. The text in the tweets has been stripped to just the non-entitiy strings (remove stock symbols, urls, etc)
* json_minute_stock.json: Generated by get_stock_prices. Contains minute by minute stock data (indexed by epoch time)
* bucketed_tweets.json: Generated by Bucketify. Contains all the tweets which were scraped, bucketed into 15 minute intervals. NLP used to compute the polarity and subjectivity of the tweet. Each bucket defines aggregate values for each attribute (sentiment values are weighted by a tweet attribute weighing function).
